              feeling like I am obligated to "proove" this, which was
              heart-breaking for me to accept and added even more weight to my
              depression and the loss of trust I have for family and, by proxy,
              trust that I can emotionally afford to give anyone.<br />I don't
              want to feel abandoned by my family anymore.

              3) Potentially, my presence alone will help keep Karl away from
              Grandma since Karl doesn't seem to care about the implications of
              undue stress his bitchfits have on her and I think most of us have
              her best interest at heart.

            <li class="list-group-item">
              4) Tom and I are well aquainted with living more minimally each
              time we change hotels -- amazing how fast shit disapears. We also
              know how to maintain a our animals in less than 300 sq/ft hotel
              rooms without being detected by sight or smell, unless, as this
              happened twice, our room was entered while we were absent
              (Bismarck tells us).

            <li class="list-group-item">
              5) I can attain a sense of safety which was been lost due to the
              aforementioned -- even leaving an hotel now, I feel at risk or
              that I will come back to a tragedy. This is not helping my PTSD. I
              CAN BARELY TOLERATE being alone in the hotel room without Tom,
              especially, when he also has Bismarck. <br />I wish you knew about
              all the things that have led up to this change in me as I am not
              as brave as I used to be.

            <li class="list-group-item">
              6) Tom is in school again because he can attain more certificates
              (though he doesn't need them imo becasue his work compared to
              people who have degrees that he doesn't are leages behind him in
              literlly every capacity) and it is very uplifting for me to be
              confdent about Tom's abilities because its the truth (this
              document is code I put together from him teaching me then fixing
              it when I get mad) and he would be more than excited to give you a
              demonstration of his talents becasue he loves to practice public
              speaking (one element to why this and many other things take so
              long to finish -- it's impossible to stop him when he starts). But
              moving constantly from hotels and previous issues that were
              exaggerated out of our control would holdback most and being
              somehwere stable where neither of us are reminded constanly of
              being hungry, our failings, making sure the animals eat becasue if
              they don't then we both agree we have failed as humans beings
              because we failed the one or multiple cats which never abandoned
              us no matter how bad things got--the cats saw what Hayden did to
              me, unfortunately, I didn't see all of what he did to Little and
              Machen . . .eliminate these stressors and we can focus on things
              normal people are allowed to focus on.

                  Grandma's life more depressng which will kill her faster, so,
                  I hardly see what our presence could do to make it much worse
                  after what I saw last visit -- I think seeing two people who
                  bicker similarly to her and papa and are more than happy to
                  spend time with her, drive her, and fill up the silence that
                  which is otherwise filled in with stories of my alleged meth
                  use and her perceived failings as a mother over Karl, is much
